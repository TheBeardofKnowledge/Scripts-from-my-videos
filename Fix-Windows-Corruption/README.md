Two very usefull scripts you can add to your toolset:

Fix-OS-Corruption is a great way to fix Windows issues by running the repair tools in the right order that are built-in to Windows.

GPUpdateFullFIX.bat Use this when a Windows PC won't get Group Policy settings from its domain controller.  It runs everything I've found is needed on a workstation in order for it to update group policy from the domain controller.  much more than gpupdate /force.
