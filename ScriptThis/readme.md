Combination of great stuff from videos I watch that should just be a script.  So I did.

*APPdeprovisioningCyberCPU.bat is a script to help you deprovision UWP apps in Windows, which prevents them from being added back to new users that sign in to the pc, even if you've already uninstalled apps under the admin account.  Many apps are part of the "baseline" packaged user apps that get installed to every user account.
 Inspired by the video by CyberCPU - Permanently Remove Windows 11 Junk

*nvmeSPEEDtweak.bat is to check for and enable the newly released Microsoft NVME driver that allows faster access speeds with your NVME drive.  The script will first validate your system compatibility to ensure it matches the requirements (Windows 11 24h2 build 26100+) and default standard NVM express controller is in use and your NVMe drive is using it.  If your manufacturer provides their own drivers (Samsung,WD,Intel,AMD,Crucial,SKhynix,Phison) then it will not apply as they use their own driver.
